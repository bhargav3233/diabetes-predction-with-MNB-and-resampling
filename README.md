--> Introduction to diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy.
Your body breaks down most of the food you eat into sugar (glucose) and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into your bodyâ€™s cells for use as energy.

--> In this project I created model which will predict whether the person have diabetes or not. I used Random Forest, KNN, Gaussian NB, and SVC, I tuned All these models. Naive BAyes gave me an Gereralized Models. I got 80% precision , recall, and f1-score for the both classes. Aldo I got Good roc-curve check the images below.

--> I Created an web app which will take the input from the user and predicts whether the person has diabtes or not.

Libraries Used :
Numpy, pandas, sklearn, seaborn,matplotlib, streamlit.
