# Diabetes Prediction 

Diabetes is a disease that has no permanent cure; hence early detection is required. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are used.

Our goal is to train a machine learning algorithm on a diabetes dataset & to make predictions on given user data as accurately as possible. For this, I  used NaiveBayes.
Once the training finishes, we will use the saved model. Begins Processing the specific input received from the user.
Users receive instant information about their diabetes status through the developed website. Depending on the results, the system will automatically display a 'Ask a Doctor' result for further processing.
